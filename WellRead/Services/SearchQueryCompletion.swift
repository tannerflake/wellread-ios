//  SearchQueryCompletion.swift
//  WellRead
//
//  Finishes a half-typed last word in a book search. Every catalog API the app
//  talks to matches whole words, so "lord of the rin" returns literal-"rin"
//  oddities and never The Lord of the Rings, no matter how the results are
//  ranked. This resolves the partial word *before* the search runs: Open
//  Library's Solr index accepts a trailing wildcard, so "lord of the rin*"
//  answers with the popular works whose titles the typed prefix could still
//  become, and the most-shelved one supplies the missing letters.
//
//  Used by `GoogleBooksService.searchDetailed`, which surfaces the completion
//  so the UI can say what it searched for and offer the literal query back.
